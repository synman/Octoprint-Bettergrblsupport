# Better Grbl Support Plugin for Octoprint

![grbl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1299716/147993411-7005d1bb-53bf-4277-9e09-5022b40ccc0b.png)

This plugin was inspired by mic159's Grbl Support plugin (https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/octoprint-grbl-plugin/).  His plugin gets you 90% of the way there for adding Grbl support to Octoprint but had a couple limitations and lacked some bells and whistles from a UI and configuration perspective.

**Better Grbl Support** originally utilized mic159's gcode receiver parser but at this point I've moved well beyond his reference implementation.  

Here are some of bgs's capabilities (as of v2.0.0):

* Fully supports Laser and CNC operations / workflows
* Provides for 10 axes of movement / jogging
* Machine and Work Positioning Homing / Origin setup
* Allows for full management of All Grbl settings ($$)
* Provides rich details for all Grbl settings, messages, alarms, and errors
* Supports Z-Probing and customization of Z-Probe settings
* 9 Point Framing and auto generation of Framing dimensions
* Detects and automatically supports Grbl 1.1 Jogging
* Fully integrates with Octoprint Start/Pause/Resume/Cancel operations
* All global configuration changes to Octoprint are reverted on uninstall
* All conversions of typical marlin/repetier/etc commands to Grbl are preset
* Disables Octoprint functions which interfere with Grbl
* Disables the built-in GCode Viewer
* Disables the built-in Temperature tab
* Disables the built-in Control tab (It can be re-enabled via Settings)
* Supports compressed/shorthand Grbl generated by numerous post processors
